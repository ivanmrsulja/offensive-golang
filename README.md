# Offensive Golang
My experiments (mostly from educational research) in weaponizing [Go](https://go.dev/) for implant development and general offensive operations.

# Why Go?
- **Native Compilation**: Compiles directly to machine code with no runtime dependencies, yielding lightweight binaries.
- **Easy Cross-Compilation**: Cross-compile for multiple OSes by setting GOOS and GOARCH, simplifying deployment.
- **Readable Syntax**: Simple, C-like syntax with modern features makes Go easy to learn and maintain.
- **Rich Standard Library**: Built-in support for networking, HTTP, JSON, and cryptographyâ€”ideal for security tools.
- **Built-in Concurrency**: Goroutines and sync packages allow high-performance, concurrent programs suited for C2 infrastructure.
- **Strong Tooling**: Tools like go test, go mod, and go vet streamline development and testing.
- **Memory Safety**: Garbage collection reduces common memory vulnerabilities without long pauses.
- **Widely Used in Security**: Popular with Red and Blue teams, with extensive libraries and examples.
- **Powerful FFI**: Integrates easily with C libraries via cgo, enabling native API interactions.
- **Modular for C2**: Simple modularity and robust networking make Go a strong choice for C2 backends and implants.
